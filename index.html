        <p>The Bear Market Company is a historical research group that also produces physical artifacts.</p>
        <p>We aim to tie today’s happenings to what’s occurred in the past. In a world that’s increasingly fluctuating — with new hype and panic cycles every day— we’re balancing out the frenetic atmosphere with a bit of historical research.</p>
        <p>We do this by slowing down and thinking about historical precedents in order to engage more deeply with the interesting news of today. Our craft is picking interesting tidbits out of the hubbub and producing artifacts that weave in their broader themes.</p>
